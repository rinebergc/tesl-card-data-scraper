==Notes==
*This card is not part of the random shout pool and thus cannot be created by cards like {{Card|Paarthurnax}}.
*Shouts that did not start in your deck are also upgraded.
*The card's art depicts [[Lore:Odahviing|Odahviing]], a [[Lore:Dragon|dragon]] who allied with the [[Lore:Hero#Last_Dragonborn|Dragonborn]] during the [[SR:Main Quest|main quest]] of ''[[SR:Skyrim|Skyrim]]''. The name of the card references the [[SR:Call Dragon|shout]] that is used to summon Odahviing.
