==Availability==
Skyshard was the [[Legends:Monthly Card|monthly card]] for February 2020. It can be soul-summoned by anybody regardless of participation in [[Legends:Ranked|ranked]]. As with all other monthly cards after February 2019, the premium version was awarded to the top 1000 [[Legends:Ranked|ranked]] players or can be obtained through soul-summoning.

==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Skyshard's Light''' card effect.
*This card depicts a [[Lore:Skyshard|skyshard]] as they [[ON:Skyshards|appeared]] in [[ON:Online|ESO]].
*If you draw a [[Legends:Double Cards|Double Card]] while Skyshard is in play, its effect will apply to both components. This holds true even if one of the two cards is not a creature. In addition to having its cost increased by two, the non-creature card will visually have two power and health as if it were a creature. However, from a gameplay perspective, these stats have no impact.
