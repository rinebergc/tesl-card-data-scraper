==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Tribal Might''' card effect.
*The card originally cost 2 Magicka and was changed because it tended to gain stats and grow large too quickly. {{ref|name=ChangeThread|[https://community.bethesda.net/thread/77022 Incoming Card Changes] on Bethesda.net, August 25, 2016}}
*The card is named for ''[[Online:Online|ESO]]'s'' [[Online:Goblin#Murkwater Tribe|Murkwater Tribe]] of goblins.
