==Notes==
*When used alongside cards such as {{Card|Tower Alchemist}}, the action {{Card|Vision of the Tenth Eye}} can be obtained when, for the given cost of the action to be drawn, no such actions exist.
*The [[Legends:Titles|title]] '''The Archmage''' is achieved by drawing a 5-cost card upon activation; currently the only ways to do so is to use College of Winterhold in conjunction with either {{Card|Tower Alchemist}} or {{Card|Cauldron Keeper}}.
*The [[Skyrim:College of Winterhold (place)|College of Winterhold]] first appeared in [[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]. For more information about College of Winterhold, see the [[Lore:College of Winterhold|lore article]].
*The audio comes from the [[Lore:36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermon 15|15th Sermon of Vivec]].
