==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Artisanal Weapon''' card effect.
*The card originally appeared in the gameplay overview video as a 2/3 card, but it was changed to 2/2 in open beta. It was changed back to 2/3 in November 2016 because the developers felt that [[Legends:Orc|Orcs]] needed a buff.{{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
*The card is named for the [[Lore:Wrothgar|Wrothgar]] region.
