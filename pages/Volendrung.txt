==Notes==
*This card's activation applies the '''Hand of Malacath''' card effect.
*[[Lore:Volendrung|Volendrung]] is the Daedric artifact of [[Lore:Malacath|Malacath]].
*The card has a unique animation in which Volendrung is shown.
* This card originally did not have breakthrough, but it was added in 11/2016 in order to give another option for late-game surprises. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
