==Notes==
*The card's exalt ability applies the '''Lord Seht''' card effect, a reference to his title.
*[[Lore:Sotha Sil|Sotha Sil]] is a god of the [[Lore:Tribunal|Tribunal]] who first [[Tribunal:Sotha Sil|appeared]] in [[MW:Morrowind|''Morrowind'']]'s [[TR:Tribunal|''Tribunal'']] expansion, and later [[Online:Sotha Sil|reappeared]] in [[Online:Online|ESO]]'s [[Online:Clockwork City (DLC)|Clockwork City]] DLC.
*The card's summon audio is an excerpt from his dialogue in [[Online:Online|ESO]]'s [[Online:The Light of Knowledge|The Light of Knowledge]] quest:
:''"I am the canvas upon which they paint their dreams and resentments. A vessel for their hopes and doubts.''
:''A mirror. Nothing more. You expect something grand, but I promised you the truth.''
*The card's attack audio is also an excerpt from the same quest:
:''"It seems I must delay my work for a time.''
:''When I reclaimed my shadow, I learned a great deal. Daedric plots. Alliances and betrayals. The return of things lost in time... the loss of things the world thought certain. I have much to do."''
