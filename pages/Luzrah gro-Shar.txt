==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Heroic Ballad''' card effect.
*This card's ability was changed from "+2/+2" to "+1/+1" in [[Legends:Patch/2.13|Patch 2.13]].
*As a female Orc, Luzrah's name doesn't follow the usual Orcish gender naming rules where "gro" is masculine and "gra" is feminine. It was revealed in an [[General:Josh Utter-Leyton Isle of Madness Interview|interview]] that when the error was caught, it was too late to fix the voice over involving her name.
