==Notes==
*The card's ability applies the '''Shor's Hall''' card effect.
*The card's ability was previously ''"Shuffle all creatures from your discard pile into your deck. Give them +5/+5 and reduce their costs by 5"'', until this was changed in [[Legends:Patch|Patch 1.70.2]].
*[[Lore:Sovngarde|Sovngarde]] is the [[Lore:Nord|Nordic]] afterlife which made an [[Skyrim:Sovngarde (place)|appearance]] in ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]''. The card's name and card effect allude to ''Skyrim'''s [[Skyrim:Sovngarde (quest)|Sovngarde]] quest, which featured a journey to Sovngarde and to [[Skyrim:Hall of Valor|Shor's Hall]] within.
