*The alternate art depicts [[Morrowind:Odral Helvi|Odral Helvi]], who first appeared in [[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]].
* This card originally had 4 power, but was changed in 11/2016 because it was a little too strong. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
*While the 0-cost copy's cost is green, indicating a temporary buff, the copies stay at 0 cost even when destroyed.
