==Notes==
*[[Lore:Wamasu|Wamasu]] are animals native to the swamps of [[Lore:Black Marsh|Black Marsh]].
*This card originally was able to deal 4 damage to any target rather than just creatures, but was changed around 10/2016 so that it wouldn't have the possibility of ending Arena games. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs Letter from the Devs] on Bethesda.net, September 29, 2016}}
