==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Dres Guard}} at level 16.
*When Dres Renegade is summoned, all friendly creatures get unshackled, and in the case of ongoing shackles (i.e. {{Card|Arrest}}) they will not become reshackled.
*The card is named for [[Lore:House Dres|House Dres]], one of the [[Lore:Great Houses|Great Houses]] of [[Lore:Morrowind|Morrowind]]. It depicts a rebellious member of the house helping [[Lore:Slavery|slaves]] escape.
