==Notes==
*A bug allowed this card to be summoned by {{Card|Shivering Apothecary}}, because Strategist's Map was designated in the files as Elixir of Illusion. An unused art named [[:File:LG-cardart-Elixir of Illusion.png|Elixir of Illusion]] was presumably intended for this card. This bug was fixed in [[Legends:Patch/2.10|patch 2.10]].
