==Notes==
*Damage dealt with Reive's ability will break [[LG:Runes|Runes]] before his attack continues.
*[[Legends:Characters#Reive|Reive]] is the secondary antagonist of [[Legends:The Forgotten Hero|The Forgotten Hero]] storyline and is encountered in multiple quests.
*Reive's ability closely resembles that of {{Card|Goldbrand}}, which he briefly wielded in the story.
*Reive was formerly 2/5 but was changed to 3/5 because the old power rating made the card vulnerable to {{Card|Execute}}.
