==Notes==
*The name of the card refers to the [[Lore:Great Houses|Great Houses]] of [[Lore:Morrowind|Morrowind]].
*In his dialogue upon being summoned (''"By the Lord, Mother and Wizard, I see their strategy!"''), the House Kinsman is referring to the three members of the [[Lore:Tribunal|Tribunal]]: [[Lore:Vivec|Vivec]], [[Lore:Almalexia|Almalexia]], and [[Lore:Sotha Sil|Sotha Sil]].
* This card originally had 3 health, but was changed in November 2016 because it was too powerful at 3 health, and changing it to 2 would make it more vulnerable to {{Card|Firebolt}} and 2-power creatures. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letters-from-the-devs-nov-2016 Letter from the Devs] on Bethesda.net, November 2, 2016}}
