==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Gates if Madness''' card effect to the drawn cards.
*The Gates of Madness previously [[Shivering:Gates of Madness|appeared]] in the [[SI:Shivering Isles|''Shivering Isles'']] expansion for [[OB:Oblivion|''Oblivion'']].
*The card art originally incorrectly placed Mania on the right and Dementia on the left, contrary to the location's previous appearance. This was later changed by flipping the card art horizontally.
