==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Vengeance''' card effect.
*When your deck is empty, Nahkriin does not draw an {{Card|Out of Cards}}, unlike other creatures that draw cards.
*The card depicts and is named for a [[Lore:Dragon Priest|Dragon Priest]] who appears in ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]'', [[Skyrim:Nahkriin (creature)|Nahkriin]].
*This card was previously called '''Dragon Priest''' in official [[:File:LG-card-Dragon Priest Old Client.png|pre-release material]].
*This card originally cost 10, with the ability "'''Summon:''' Draw a card. The next card you play this turn is free.".  It was changed in 11/2016 because the developers felt it was limiting future design space.{{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
*The summoning audio was changed upon the client change and are now skeleton sounds. The old one can be heard here:<br/>{{Legends Audio|noheader=1|card=Nahkriin Dragon Priest|use=enter play|text=Come. Face your end.}}
