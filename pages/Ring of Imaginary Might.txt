==Notes==
*When first revealed, Paul Dennen, Creative Director at Direwolf Digital, described the card as follows: ''"The search for a wielder of a Ring of Imaginary Might is fairly straightforward â€“ you'll want creatures with low power but high health. For these creatures, the Ring provides a significant buff. For example, an Oldgate Warden (0/5 with Regenerate) would love to get his hands on this item. The Warden is normally a defensive, quiet fellow, but give him the ring and he'll be drunk with power, smashing in as a 7/7 with Regenerate!"''
