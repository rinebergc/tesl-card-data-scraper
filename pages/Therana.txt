==Notes==
*The card's ability applies the '''A Gift''' effect, which persists into the Discard Pile.
*Therana also [[Morrowind:Therana|appeared]] in [[Morrowind:Morrowind|''Morrowind'']] and later in [[Online:Magister Therana|ESO]].
*In ''Morrowind'', Therana is insane and the [[Lore:Kwama|Kwama]] eggs behind her are a reference to her quirk of using them as decorations instead of food in ''Morrowind''.
