==Availability==
A playset of the card is awarded for completing [[Legends:Forelhost Front Gate|Forelhost Front Gate]]. The premium version can only be obtained by [[Legends:Soul Gems#Soul Summoning|soul-summoning]], which is only possible after the completion of Forelhost Front Gate.

==Notes==
*Hallowed Deathpriest's ability always ignores Shriveled Mummy, even if it is the creature with the highest cost in the hand or the only creature in the hand.  
*This card depicts one of the [[Skyrim:Dragon Priest#Named Dragon Priests|masked Dragon Priests]] introduced in ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]'', although it is unclear which one in particular.
