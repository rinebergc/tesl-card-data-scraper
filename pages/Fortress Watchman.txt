==Notes==
* This was originally a rare card, but was changed around 10/2016 to help balance quality of common cards. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs Letter from the Devs] on Bethesda.net, September 29, 2016}}
*The card's opening audio, ''"There is always a blood price"'', refers to the [[Lore:Orc|Orcish]] tradition of bleeding criminals as punishment.
