*The card was originally named "Skingrad Soldier" and was renamed to "Kvatch Soldier" prior to open beta. In fall 2016, during the Open Beta period, the card's art was swapped with that of {{Card|Colovian Trooper}}, ostensibly to add the emblem of Kvatch to its art.
*A Kvatch Soldier first [[OB:Kvatch Soldier|appeared]] in ''[[OB:Oblivion|Oblivion]]''.
* The card's voice lines are performed by Travis Willingham.
