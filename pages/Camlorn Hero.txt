==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Camlorn Adventurer}} at level 7.
*The card is named for the [[Lore:High Rock|High Rock]] city of [[Lore:Camlorn|Camlorn]]. 
*The quote ''"I used to be an adventurer, like you"'' is likely a reference to a famous line of [[Skyrim:Guard_Dialogue|guard dialogue]] from ''Skyrim'': ''"I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow in the knee..."'' However, it also refers to the fact that the card is trained from 'Camlorn Adventurer'.
