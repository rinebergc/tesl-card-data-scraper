==Notes==
*This card's exalt ability applies the '''Sacred Lady''' card effect.
*Her summon and attack audio are taken from her dialogue in [[Online:Online|ESO]]'s [[Online:The Seal of Three|The Seal of Three]] quest:
::''"Rage consumes me! The Maulborn invade my home. They attack my children. They attack me!''
::''You have proven yourself loyal and capable. I call upon you to serve me once more."''
*[[Lore:Almalexia|Almalexia]] first [[Tribunal:Almalexia|appeared]] in ''[[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]]'''s ''[[Tribunal:Tribunal|Tribunal]]'' expansion, and later [[Online:Almalexia|reappeared]] in [[Online:Online|ESO]].
