==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Apprentice's Potion}} at level 18.
*This card originally cost 1, but was changed in 11/2016 in order to steer players away from taking damage in order to lose a rune and then immediately healing themselves. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
*The card's art depicts one of ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]'''s [[Skyrim:Alchemy Labs|alchemy labs]].
