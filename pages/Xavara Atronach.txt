==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Daedric Hunger''' card effect.
*This card is named after the ruins of [[SI:Xavara|Xavara]], which previously appeared in the [[SI:Shivering Isles|''Shivering Isles'']] expansion for [[OB:Oblivion|''Oblivion'']]. The ruins were inhabited by [[Lore:Zealots|Zealots]] who possessed the ability to summon [[Lore:Flesh Atronach|Flesh Atronachs]] like the one depicted in the card's art.
