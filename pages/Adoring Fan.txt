}} You receive one the first time you defeat a [[Legends:Solo Arena|Solo Arena]] boss, or the first time you finish the [[Legends:Versus Arena|Versus Arena]] with seven wins. Finishing a Versus Arena during the [[Legends:Chaos Arena|Chaos Arena]] event with seven wins will also provide you with a copy of the card. A premium version is awarded when reaching the rank of Grand Champion in either Solo Arena or Versus Arena.

The somewhat cryptic text ''"Adoring Fan will return"'' means that, after it is destroyed, it will be summoned into either [[Legends:Lanes|lane]] at any point during the game from the discard pile.

==Notes==
*The Adoring Fan is a reference to ''[[Oblivion:Oblivion|Oblivion]]''{{'}}s [[Oblivion:Adoring Fan|Adoring Fan]], who became a follower in much the same way as this card is earned and would eventually respawn if killed.
*This card cannot be seen in your collection, even when viewing unowned cards, until you have earned it.

==Bugs==
* A bug that allowed Adoring Fan to be soul trapped with the mass trap interface was fixed in [[Legends:Patch/2.13|Patch 2.13]], with the note "The small pitter-patter of rushed footsteps can be heard in the distance, seemingly getting closer..."
** Those who did soul trap the adoring fan received a message titled ''Adoring Fan Has Returned!'' with the content ''"Hey... you were walking pretty fast back there. Almost lost you. But I finally caught up. I've missed you."''
