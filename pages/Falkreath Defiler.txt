==Notes==
*The card's ability applies the '''Risen Dead''' card effect.
*The card is named for the [[Lore:Skyrim|Skyrim]] town of [[Lore:Falkreath|Falkreath]].
*This card was nerfed by changing its slay effect from "Summon" to "Draw" so the creatures are now returned to your hand instead of the board in [[Legends:Patch/2.11|Patch 2.11]].
