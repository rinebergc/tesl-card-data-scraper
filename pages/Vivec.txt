==Notes==
*The card's ability applies the '''Vivec's Protection''' card effect to itself and the '''Immortal''' effect to you.
*The card's exalt ability applies the '''Warrior Poet''' card effect.
*Vivec's second ability will prevent game loss from {{Card|Out of Cards}} as that only reduces your health to 0, but not from alternative win conditions like {{Card|Jarl Balgruuf}}, {{Card|Unite the Houses}}, or {{Card|Time is Running Out!}}.
*[[Lore:Vivec|Vivec]] also appeared in ''[[MW:Vivec (god)|Morrowind]]'' and [[ON:Vivec|ESO]].
*The audio played when this card is summoned is a reference to Vivec's dialogue in ''Morrowind''. If asked about being a god, he would reply, ''"It is like being a juggler. Things are always moving, and you learn to know where they are without even thinking about it."''
