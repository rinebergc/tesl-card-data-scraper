== Notes ==

*Prior to January 2017, this card would give permanent [[Legends:Drain|Drain]] rather than temporary Drain. This was changed due to its ability to gain you much more health than was previously lost.{{ref|name=Jan2017|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs-jan-2017 Letter from the Devs] from Bethesda.net, January 11 2017}}
