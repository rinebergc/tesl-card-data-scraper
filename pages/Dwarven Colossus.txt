==Notes==
*The Power Sphere's trigger applies the '''Powered Up''' card effect.
*Dwarven Colossus will only get keywords from its own summoned Power Spheres. This still applies after the Power Sphere has been [[LG:Unsummon|unsummoned]] and played again.
*Dwarven Colossus first [[Online:Dwarven Colossus|appeared]] in [[Online:Online|ESO]].
*There is evidence that this card specifically depicts the [[Online:Assembly General|Assembly General]], who first appeared in ESO. The [[Legends:Power Sphere|Power Spheres]] he summons are a reference to one of the mechanics he has with the [[Lore:Dwarven Sentry|Dwemer Sentries]] known as [[Online:Terminal|Terminals]], Furthermore, His background showcases the final boss fight area within the assembly lines of the [[Online:Halls of Fabrication|Halls of Fabrication]].
