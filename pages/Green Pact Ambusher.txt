==Notes==
*The name of the card refers to the [[Lore:Green Pact|Green Pact]] practiced by the [[Lore:Bosmer|Bosmer]] of [[Lore:Valenwood|Valenwood]].
*The card used the female Wood Elves greeting emote audio (''"Greetings."'') as summoning line when it was first released. Its current summoning line references that.
