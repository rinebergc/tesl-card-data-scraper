==Availability==
A playset of the card is awarded for completing [[Legends:Baron's Palace|Baron's Palace]]. The premium version can only be obtained if you purchased the [[Legends:Purchases#Isle of Madness Premium Pre-Order|Isle of Madness Premium Pre-Order]] or by [[Legends:Soul Gems#Soul Summoning|soul-summoning]], which is only possible after the completion of Baron's Palace.

==Notes==
*This card depicts one of the [[Lore:Rings of Lordship|Rings of Lordship]] which previously [[Shivering:Ring of Lordship (Dementia)|appeared]] in the [[SI:Shivering Isles|''Shivering Isles'']] expansion for [[OB:Oblivion|''Oblivion'']], although it is unclear which one as it resembles neither.

==Bugs==
*Unlike other story rewards, there is no notification after completing Baron's Palace that any rewards are given.
