==Availability==
In addition to the card's availability in the [[Legends:Core Set|Core Set]], one copy is included in the [[Legends:Brynjolf's Heist|Brynjolf's Heist]] theme deck.

==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Twilight Werebat}} at level 26.
*This card originally had 3 health, but was changed in 11/2016 because it was too powerful at 3 health as a Prophecy card, and changing it to 2 would make it less likely to immediately kill 2-power creatures. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
