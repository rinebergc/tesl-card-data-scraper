==Notes==
*This card and its effects are a reference to the [[OB:Horse Armor Pack|Horse Armor]] [[OB:Downloads|DLC]] for ''[[OB:Oblivion|The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''.{{ref|[https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/1182400389267759105 Pete Hines (@DCDeacon) October 10, 2019 via Twitter]}} The first paid DLC ever released by [[General:Bethesda|Bethesda]], Horse Armor was heavily criticized for its premium price point despite doing little more than making your horse slightly healthier and prettier. The card's art depicts the steel version of the armor.
