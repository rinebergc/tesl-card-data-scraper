==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Pillaging''' card effect.
*Prior to January 2017, this card would give all creatures in its lane drain for one turn. This was changed due to its ability to gain you much more health than was previously lost.{{ref|name=Jan2017|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs-jan-2017 Letter from the Devs] from Bethesda.net, January 11 2017}}
