==Blood Magic==
'''Blood Magic Spells''' are legendary Endurance cards, all with a cost of 2. When they are inserted into your hand, they have a red tint. Each of them is based on a power of [[Skyrim:Vampire Lord|Vampire Lord]]s in ''[[Skyrim:Dawnguard|Dawnguard]]''. A list of Blood Magic cards follows:

*{{Card|Corpse Curse}}
*{{Card|Drain Life}}

==Notes==
*Considering the [[Legends:Houses of Morrowind|Houses of Morrowind]] vampire clan cards depict the leaders of the [[Lore:Berne Clan|Berne]] and [[Lore:Quarra Clan|Quarra]] clans, this card is likely intended to depict [[Morrowind:Dhaunayne Aundae|Dhaunayne Aundae]], leader of the [[Lore:Aundae Clan|Aundae]] clan from ''[[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]]''.
