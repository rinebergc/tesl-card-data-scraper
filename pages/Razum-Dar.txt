==Notes==
*If your opponent has already drawn a card(s) before Razum-Dar was summoned that turn, its effect will still trigger if they draw another card while Razum-Dar is in play.
*If you take control of your opponent's Razum-Dar during your turn, its effect will not be applied if they draw a card. This is because your opponent already used the effect when you drew a card at the start of your turn.  
**If you took control of a Razum-Dar summoned by your opponent after the start of your turn, you could use its effect so long as your opponent has not already that turn. 
*The card's art depicts [[Online:Razum-dar|Razum-dar]], who first appeared in [[Online:Online|ESO]].
