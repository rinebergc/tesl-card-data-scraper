==Notes==
*The card previously had 4 health, but this was increased in [[Legends:Patch/1.72.4|patch 1.72.4]].
*[[Morrowind:Duke Vedam Dren|Duke Vedam Dren]] first appeared in ''[[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]]'', and the card's audio is based on two lines from that appearance:
**''"Don't make enemies. If someone is determined to be your enemy, then fight. But do not turn friends or potential friends into enemies through arrogance or carelessness."''
**''"Use your rank and influence to help the people of Vvardenfell."''
