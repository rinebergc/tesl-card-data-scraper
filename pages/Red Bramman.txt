== Notes ==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''A Pirate's Life''' card effect. For unknown reasons, this effect is applied three times upon the enemy creatures.
*Red Bramman is mentioned in the ''[[Lore:Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Edition/Argonia|Pocket Guide to the Empire]]'' and the ''[[Lore:The Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel/Black Marsh|Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel]]'', although these books state that he is human.
*Red Bramman also shows up as [[Legends:Practice/Red Bramman|an NPC]] in [[LG:Practice|Practice mode]].
