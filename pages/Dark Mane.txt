==Notes==
*The Dark Mane first [[Online:Dark Mane|appeared]] in [[ESO:Online|ESO]].
*This card depicts [[Online:Akkhuz-ri|Mane Akkhuz-ri]] under the influence of the Dark Mane. The background appears to be erroneously based on [[Lore:Mistral|Mistral]], despite the fact that Akkhuz-ri was possessed in the city of [[Lore:Arenthia|Arenthia]].
