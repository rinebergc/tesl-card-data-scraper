==Building a custom creature==
====Choose a Fabricant body====
When you summon this card, you'll get to choose between three different versions of {{Card|Custom Fabricant}}. Their cost, attack, and health values are random, but will always be in ascending order. For example, the values of version one can be anywhere between 1 and 10{{vn|never got higher than 7 for now}} and the values of version two can range between 2 and 11, but will always be higher than the values of version one and lower than those of version three and the values of version three will range between 3-12.

====Choose an ability for the Fabricant====
After you have chosen the attack and health value, you get to choose between one of three different abilities randomly selected from the following list:
