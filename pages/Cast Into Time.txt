==Notes==
*If creatures with [[Legends:Last Gasp|Last Gasp]] are targeted, their last gasp effect won't trigger because they're not technically killed.
*This card was changed by removing "and all creatures from your opponent's deck with the same name" in [[Legends:Patch/2.11|Patch 2.11]].
*This card depicts the banishment of [[Lore:Alduin|Alduin]].
