==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Dune Rogue}} at level 21.
*Prior to January 2017, this card would move any friendly creature. This was changed because it could render an opponent's cards ineffective while concentrating power in one lane.{{ref|name=Jan2017|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs-jan-2017 Letter from the Devs] from Bethesda.net, January 11 2017}}
*The card is named for the [[Lore:Elsweyr|Elsweyr]] city of [[Lore:Dune|Dune]], which first [[Arena:Dune|appeared]] in ''[[Arena:Arena|Arena]]'', and later [[Online:Dune|reappeared]] in [[Online:Online|ESO]].
