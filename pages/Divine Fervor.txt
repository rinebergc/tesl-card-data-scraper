*This card's magicka cost was increased from 4 to 5 in [[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|patch 1.59.7]] because Spellsword token decks in Arena were too strong.
*This card's art depicts a [[SR:Shrine of Stendarr#Shrine_of_Stendarr|shrine]] of [[Lore:Stendarr|Stendarr]] in the background.
*The alternate art depicts the [[Online:Drake of Blades|Drake of Blades]] as an Avatar of [[Lore:Akatosh|Akatosh]].
