==Notes==
*The symbol painted above the bed in the card's art is one of the [[Lore:Shadowmarks|shadowmarks]] employed by the [[Lore:Skyrim|Skyrim]] branch of the [[Lore:Thieves Guild|Thieves Guild]]. This specific symbol indicates that the location has been scouted and deemed safe by a guildmember. Shadowmarks were first [[SR:Shadowmarks (Thieves Guild)|seen]] in ''[[SR:Skyrim|The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''.
*This card's pilfer ability applies the '''Thievery''' card effect.
