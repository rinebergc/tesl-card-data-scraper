==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Challenged''' card effect.
*This card is a reference to [[Morrowind:Anhaedra|Anhaedra]] from [[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]]. The [[Morrowind:Maar_Gan_Shrine|Maar Gan Shrine]] is visible behind him in the card art.
**The attacking dialogue for this card is a reference to a much more brutal quote from the Dremora's original appearance.
