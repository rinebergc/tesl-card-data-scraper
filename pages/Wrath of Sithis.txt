==Availability==

==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Sithis' Wrath''' card effect.
*If Wrath of Sithis is summoned by your opponent during your turn, its effect will apply immediately rather than during your opponent's next turn or your next turn. 
*The card is named for the mysterious punishment threatened by [[Lore:The Five Tenets|''The Five Tenets'']]. It depicts the [[Lore:Wrath of Sithis|Wrath of Sithis]] as it [[OB:Wrath of Sithis|appeared]] in ''[[OB:Oblivion|Oblivion]]''.
