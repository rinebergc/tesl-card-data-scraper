==Notes==
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Qualified''' card effect.
*When your opponent only has cards with the same name left in their hand and deck, you can only choose that card and the summon ability will always activate.
*If your opponent has no cards in their hand, the summon ability will not activate.
*There's an action card with similar effects depicting Cosades, named [[Legends:Caius' Machinations|Caius' Machinations]].
*Caius Cosades also [[Morrowind:Caius Cosades|appeared]] in ''[[Morrowind:Morrowind|Morrowind]]''.
**For more information on recurring characters, please [[General:Recurring Characters|see the main article]].
