==Notes==
*Prior to August 2016, this card would reduce the cost of the next card played by 6. This was changed to reducing the next '''creature summoned''' by '''5''' in order to lessen the impact of playing more expensive cards earlier, which had led to "swingy" games. {{ref|name=ChangeThread|[https://community.bethesda.net/thread/77022 Incoming Card Changes] on Bethesda.net, August 25, 2016}}
*Prior to January 2017, this card had a cost of 5 and reduced the cost of cards by the same value. Both of these values were changed to 6 due to providing board advantage at too early a stage of the game.{{ref|name=Jan2017|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs-jan-2017 Letter from the Devs] from Bethesda.net, January 11 2017}}
