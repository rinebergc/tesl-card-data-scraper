==Notes==
*This card is called "Syldarim Astrologer" in the files. In ''[[ON:Online|The Elder Scrolls Online]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s original version of [[Online:Cut Content/Aldmeri Dominion#Summerset|Summerset]], the Syldarim were an Altmeri [[Lore:Kinhouse|Kinhouse]] found around The Orrery that would help the [[Lore:The Vestige|player]] restore the [[Lore:Akatosh (planet)|planet of Auri-El]] back to the sky. The cut drafts also state that ''"The Sapiarch of Astronomy at the Crystal Tower has nearly always been a Syldarim. Genivra, now High Kinlady of the Syldarim, held that position herself before the Ascendance of the previous High Kinlady."'' which may help explain what the card was intended to depict.
