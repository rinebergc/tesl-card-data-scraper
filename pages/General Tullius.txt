==Notes==
*This card's ability applies the '''Glory of the Empire''' card effect.
*[[Skyrim:General Tullius|General Tullius]] first appeared in ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]''.
**According to [[General:Pete Hines|Hines]], they did not use Michael Hogan's voice lines from ''Skyrim'' as they would have to re-hire him for the game.
*The card art uses a [https://i.imgur.com/RRYeUXp.jpg frame] from the film ''[[wikipedia:1612 (film)|1612]]'' as a base reference. It was later adjusted after this was brought up to Pete Hines.
