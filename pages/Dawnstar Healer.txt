==Notes==
*Prior to July 2017 and Update 65.2, the card's ability read "When an enemy rune is destroyed, you gain 3 health." This was changed to allow more interactivity with runes and [[Legends:Prophecy|prophecies]].
*The Daedric script of the healing spell reads {{DaedricFont|size=small|ON YOUR FEET YOU LAZY BUM}} which transliterate to: "on your feet you lazy bum".
*The card is named for the [[Lore:Skyrim|Skyrim]] town of [[Lore:Dawnstar|Dawnstar]].
