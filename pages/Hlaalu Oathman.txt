==Notes==
*This card was nerfed by reducing its stats from 2/2 to 1/1 in [[Legends:Patch/2.11|Patch 2.11]].
*This card is likely intended to depict [[Morrowind:Almse Arenim|Almse Arenim]] from [[Morrowind:Morrowind|''Morrowind'']], as evident by her hairstyle, her rank of oathman, and her skill in short blades.
