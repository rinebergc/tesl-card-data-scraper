==Notes==
*The card's art depicts [[Skyrim:Old Salty|Old Salty]], who first appeared in ''[[Skyrim:Dragonborn|Dragonborn]]''.
*It is possible to summon an extra mudcrab while playing against an AI opponent that has the unobtainable card {{Card|Foraging Mudcrab}} in its deck, such as [[Legends:Practice/Warden of the Pass|Warden of the Pass]] or [[Legends:Practice/Blind Aggression|Blind Aggression]]. If you [[Legends:Steal|steal]] and subsequently shuffle Foraging Mudcrab into your own deck, it will be seen by Old Salty's Assault as yet another mudcrab.
