==Notes==
*When summoned, you are prompted to "Choose a creature to hunt." This is most likely a reference to the notorious bug from ''[[OB:Oblivion|The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' where the [[Oblivion:King_of_Miscarcand|King of Miscarcand]] and his two Zombie Guardians would pursue you anywhere in Cyrodiil, making you unable to sleep, wait or fast travel.
*His name was revealed to be Morimath in [[Online:Online|ESO]]. For more information, see the [[Lore:Morimath|lore article]]
