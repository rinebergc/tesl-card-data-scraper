==Notes==
*The card's art depicts a [[Lore:Golden Saint|Golden Saint]] being summoned.
* This card originally cost 2, but was changed in 11/2016 because it was too efficient at 2-cost, and at 3-cost it would feel like more of a cost to create a copy of your best creature. {{ref|name=LetterDevs|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letters-from-the-devs-nov-2016 Letter from the Devs] on Bethesda.net, November 2, 2016}}
