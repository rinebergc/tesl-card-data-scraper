== Notes ==
*[[Lore:Sunken One|The Sunken One]] first [[OB:The Sunken One (creature)|appeared]] as a powerful [[Lore:Storm Atronach|storm atronach]] encountered during a [[Oblivion:The Sunken One (quest)|quest]] in ''[[OB:Oblivion|Oblivion]]''. The card depicts the Sunken One hovering over the corpse of [[Oblivion:Slythe Seringi|Slythe Seringi]], a [[Lore:Dunmer|Dunmer]] who wrongly believed that the Sunken One, who he worshipped, was responsible for the destruction of [[Lore:Kvatch|Kvatch]] during the [[Lore:Oblivion Crisis|Oblivion Crisis]]. In a misguided attempt to prevent further destruction, Slythe plunged into the [[OB:Sandstone Cavern|Sandstone Cavern]] to present an offering to appease the Sunken One, but the only reward for his bravery was death at the hands of his own idol.
