==Notes==
*This card is based on the cannibal chef [[Skyrim:Knjakr|Knjakr]], who first appeared in ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]''.
*This card's summon ability applies the '''Tasty Treat''' card effect.
*For the 14th, 15th, and 16th [[Legends:Login Rewards|login rewards]] in February 2018, one alternate art copy of the card was awarded. It is themed for [[Lore:Calendar#Heart's Day|Heart's Day]], the Tamrielic equivalent to Valentine's Day.  The alternate art version of the card also creates similarly-themed alternate art {{Card|Sweet Roll|Sweet Rolls}}.
*The [[Online:Grisly Gourmet|Grisly Gourmet]] item set in [[ON:Online|ESO]] is inspired by this card.
