==Notes==
*This card's werewolf transformation applies the '''Companionship''' card effect on all Werewolves and the '''Companion Leader''' on itself.
*This card's Beast Form triggers after other creatures' Beast Form transformations, to ensure that it buffs all Werewolves that enter Beast Form. Originally it would also trigger after prophecies, but this was a glitch fixed in [[LG:Patch/1.66.1|Patch 1.66.1]], and it now triggers before prophecies like the other Werewolf transformations.
*This card depicts [[Skyrim:Kodlak Whitemane|Kodlak Whitemane]] from ''[[Skyrim:Skyrim|Skyrim]]''.
