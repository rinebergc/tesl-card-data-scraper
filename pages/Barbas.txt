==Notes==
*[[Lore:Barbas|Barbas]] first appeared in ''[[Daggerfall:Daggerfall|Daggerfall]]'', and later reappeared in [[Redguard:Dog|''Redguard'']], [[Oblivion:Clavicus Vile|''Oblivion'']], [[Skyrim:Barbas|''Skyrim'']], and [[Online:Barbas|ESO]]. The card depicts him as he appeared in ''Skyrim''.
*The card's creature type was originally solely Beast.
**This was changed to Daedra in [[Legends:Patch/1.66.0|Patch 1.66.0]].
**The Beast subtype was added alongside Daedra in [[Legends:Patch/1.68.0|Patch 1.68.0]].
*The card's summon audio is a modified excerpt from ''Skyrim'''s [[Skyrim:A Daedra's Best Friend|A Daedra's Best Friend]] quest:
*:''"Skyrim is now host to giant, flying lizards and two-legged cat-men... and you're surprised by me? Yes. I just talked. And am continuing to do so."''
*The card's Fetch audio is a modified excerpt from the same quest:
*:''"You are exactly what I was looking for."''
*The card's Roll Over dialogue is an excerpt from the same quest:
*:''"I know, I know... Wars to fight, dragons to confront, guild business to conduct. Listen, when you're ready to do something useful, find me outside Haemar's Shame, in Falkreath."''
