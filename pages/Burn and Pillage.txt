==Notes==
*The art for this card originally appeared on a card called "Raze" in the Gameplay Overview video. "Raze" became "{{Card|Edict of Azura}}" prior to open beta, while the art was reused for {{Card|Siege of Stros M'Kai}} in the [[LG:Forgotten Hero Collection|Forgotten Hero Collection]].
*The card's art features a map of [[Lore:Cyrodiil|Cyrodiil]] centered on [[Lore:Topal Bay|Topal Bay]] and [[Lore:Blackwood|Blackwood]].
*The card originally cost 6 and dealt the damage to all enemy creatures, not just in one lane, but was changed for the following reason: ''"Previously, Burn and Pillage too often decimated the chances of a player who is on the back foot trying to make a comeback. While we want clear and effective payoffs for destroying runes, the lack of counter-play to Burn and Pillage has been a concern. The updated design makes more sense with the lane system, while still providing the ability to close the door on an opponent who is trying to contest an aggressive strategy."''
