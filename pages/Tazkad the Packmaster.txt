== Notes ==
* This card originally cost 8 rather than 9, but was changed in the 11/2016 update so that it wouldn't be as "consistently devastating" as it used to be.{{ref|name=LetterDevs|[[Legends:Patch/1.59.7.2610|Letter from the Devs]] on Bethesda.net, November 16, 2016}}
*Tazkad the Packmaster first [[Online:Tazkad the Packmaster|appeared]] in [[Online:Online|ESO]].
