==Notes==
*The card's summon ability applies the '''Master Crafted''' card effect.
*[[Lore:Yagrum Bagarn|Yagrum Bagarn]] first [[Morrowind:Yagrum Bagarn|appeared]] in [[Morrowind:Morrowind|''Morrowind'']], and the name of the Master Crafted card effect alludes to Bagarn's former occupation as Master Crafter.
