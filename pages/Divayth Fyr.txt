==Daughters of Fyr==
At the start of each of your turns, Divayth Fyr's ability will summon one of his daughters, in alphabetical order. They are identical to each other apart from appearance and audio. The Daughters of Fyr are:
#{{Card|Alfe Fyr}}
#{{Card|Beyte Fyr}}
#{{Card|Delte Fyr}}
#{{Card|Uupse Fyr}}

If Divayth Fyr's effect remains active for more than four turns, he will begin the sequence again with Alfe Fyr.

== Audio ==
{{Legends Audio 2|use=enter play|text=I can't waste energy talking to boring people.|text2=Yes? What is it?}}
{{Legends Audio 2|use=attack|text=By House Telvanni!|text2=You bore me!|text3=This will end in blood!}}
