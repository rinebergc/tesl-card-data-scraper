==Notes==
*This card was previously part of the [[Legends:Training|training]] mechanic where it could be upgraded from {{Card|Slaughterfish}} at level 28.
*Prior to January 2017, this card had a cost of 3. This was changed due to a lack of effective countermeasures at that cost.{{ref|name=Jan2017|[https://legends.bethesda.net/articles/letter-from-the-devs-jan-2017 Letter from the Devs] from Bethesda.net, January 11 2017}}
